### üå± Description
---
This Repository contains the demos of OpenGL applications. These demos are focused on various aspects of real time rendering like **2D/3D geometry shapes rendering, applying textures, lighting, model loading, camera movements, advanced opengl concepts, advanced lighting, pbr**. In the end there is also one game developed which uses the concepts learned during these demo creation.
